-- Phase 1: Remove the problematic "User Accounts and Login" table
-- This table is not needed as Supabase handles authentication through auth.users
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "User Accounts and Login";

-- Ensure workout_logs table has proper structure and RLS
-- (Table already exists with proper RLS policies, this is just verification)
-- The table structure is already correct with user_id, target_pushups, completed_pushups, etc.
